1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

        Server side routing occurs when there is actual communication between the webpage and a server, that then has to load up a whole new page to the user,
        depending on the interaction that took place. In server-side routing every request that is sent to the server means that an entire page needs to be loaded or reloaded. 
        However, with client side routing, all of the requests are made internally and no communication has to be made with the server, because all of the requests are
        handled by the JavaScript that is coded on that particular page.
